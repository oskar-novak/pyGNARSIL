pyGNARSIL is an improved version of our original GNARSIL algorithm given in  https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10821364.

pyGNARSIL now is faster due to its Branch and Bound type structure, and can also support non CSS stabilizer codes. 

To USE:

1: Prepare Code in np array with $\[L_{X},S,L_{Z}\]$ form.

2: Create list with row numbers of stabilizers you wish to split

3: Enter weight of each gauge. 

4: Enter number of gauges per stabilizer.
